CZO Display File v2 Specification
===============

The [CZO Display File v1](http://criticalzone.org/national/publications/pub/whitenack-et-al-2011-czo-display-file-specification/) format was developed in 2010-2011 as a means for [US Critical Zone Observatories](http://criticalzone.org/) to share data in a form that was both human readable and machine parseable. The header provides metadata that allows the comma-separated data to be ingested into an Observations Data Model 1.1 database, such as a CUAHSI Hydroserver.

Our goal for *CZO Display File v2* is to substantially extend the CZO Display File specification to meet the following requirements:
* Human readable
* Machine parseable
* Serve as an archival format for an ODM2 "Dataset"
